# Why should I Learn Go? (Advantatges of Go)

## Advantatges
1. Code runs fast
2. Garbage collection
3. Simpler objects
4. Concurrency is efficient

## Software translation
Three major classes of languages:
1. Machine language
    - CPU instructions represented in binary
    - Straightforward and simple
2. Assembly language
    - CPU instructions with mnemonics
    - 1 to 1 mapping to machine language
    - Easier to read
3. High-level language
    - Commonly used languages
    - Much easier to use
    - Provide variables, types, if statements, loops, etc

All software **must** be _translated_ to machine language.

## Complied vs Interpreted
1. Compilation: Translate instructions once **before** running the code
    - C, C++, Java (partially)
    - Translation occurs **only once** and saves time

2. Interpretation: Translate instructions **while** the code is executed
    - Python, Java (partially)
    - Translation occurs **every execution**
    - Requires an interpreter

## Efficiency vs Ease-Of-Use
Compiled code is faster \
Interpreters make coding easier \
    - Manage memory automatically
    - Infer variable types

**Go is a good compromise**

## Garbage collection
1. Automatic memory management (Easier)
    - Where should memory be allocated?
    - When can memory be allocated?
2. Manual memory management (Difficult)
    - Deallocate too early --> false memory accesses
    - Deallocate too late --> waster memory

Go includes garbage collection
- Typically done by interpreters
- Slows down execution a bit, but is efficient
