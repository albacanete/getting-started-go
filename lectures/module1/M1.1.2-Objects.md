# Objects

Go is weakly object oriented: it implements Objects but have fewer features than in other Object-oriented languages like Python. 

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Organize your code through **encapsulation**
- Group together data and functions which are related
- User-defined type which is specific to an application
    - Ints have data: the number and functions (+,-,*,...)

### Object example
Implementing an application performing geometry in 3D
- Many functions will operate in *points*
    - **Data**: x, y and z coords
    - **Functions**: DistToOrigin(), Quadrant(), ...

*Point* **class** defines data and functions. \
*Point* **objects** are instances of class.

## Objects in Go
Go does **not** use the term class. It uses **structs** with associated methods, which are a simplified implementation of classes.
- No inheritance
- No constructors
- No generics
