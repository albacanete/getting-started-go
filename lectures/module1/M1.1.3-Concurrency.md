# Concurrency

## Performance Limits
- **Moore's Law**: number of transistors doubles every 18 months
- More transistors used to lead to speed up
    - Higher clock rates
- **Power/temperature constraints** limit clock frequencies now

## Parallelism
- Number of cores still increases over time
- Multiple tasks may be performed at the same time on different cores
    - Potential improve of throughput
- Has difficulties
    - When do tasks start/stop?
    - What if another task needs data from another task?
    - Do tasks conflict in memory?

## Concurrent programming
- It consists in the management of multiple tasks at the same time
    - There are not executing at the same time but they are alive at the same time
        - Maybe one is paused while the other is running but both are alive at the same time
    - They could be running at the same time if you had the resources (multiple cores)
- Enables parallelism
    - Management of task execution
    - Communication between tasks
    - Synchronization between tasks

## Concurrency in Go
- Go includes concurrency primitives implemented efficiently
- **Goroutines** represent concurrent tasks 
    - Basically a thread
- **Channels** are used to communicate between tasks
- **Select** enables task synchronization
