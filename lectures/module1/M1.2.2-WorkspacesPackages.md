# Workspaces and Packages

## Workspaces
Directory where your Go files will go. 
- Hierarchy of directories
- Common organization is good for sharing (for people to work together easily)
- Three subdirectories
    - src: contains source code files
    - pkg: contains packages (libraries)
    - bin: contains executables
- Programmer typically has one workspace for many projects


### Workspace information
- Directory hierarchy is recommended but **not enforced**
- Workspace directory is defined by **GOPATH** env variable
    - Defined automatically during installation
- **Go tools assume that code is in GOPATH**

## Packages
- Group of related source files
- Each package can be imported by other packages
- Good for software reuse
- First line of file names the package: `package test`
    - Imported with `import` statement from other source files
- There **must** be one package called `main`
    - When built, an executable program is generated
