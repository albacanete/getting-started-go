# Go Tool

## Import
- `import` is a keyword used to access other packages
- Go standard library includes many packages
    - "fmt", "net/http", etc
- Searches directories specified by **GOROOT** and **GOPATH**

## The Go Tool
- General tool to manage Go source code
- `go build` compiles the program
    - arguments can be a list of packages or a list of `.go` files
    - creates an executable for the `main` package with same name as the first `.go` file

### Go Tool Commands
- `go doc` prints documentation for a package
- `go fmt` formats source code files (indentation is not mandatory for Go to function, like Python, but is nice)
- `go get` downloads packages and installs them
- `go list` lists all installed packages
- `go run` compiles `.go` files and runs the executable
- `go test` runs tests using files ending in `_test.go`
