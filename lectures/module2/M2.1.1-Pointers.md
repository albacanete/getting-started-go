# Pointers

- Address to some data in memory
- `&` returns the address of a variable/function
- `*` returns data at an address (dereferencing)

### Example 
```go
var x int = 1
var y int
var ip *int // ip is a pointer to int

ip = &x     // ip now points to the address of x
            // &x is the address where I can find value 1
y = *ip     // y is now 1
```

## New
- Alternate way to create a variable
- `new()` function creates a variable and returns a pointer to a variable
    - Variable is initialized to 0
    ```go
    ptr := new(int)     // *ptr = 0
    *ptr = 3
    ```
