# Variable Scope

Places in the code where a variable can be accessed. 

### Example 1
In this example both functions will have access to `x`.

```go
var x = 4

func f() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}

func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```

### Example 2
In this example, `x` is defined inside `f()`, so function `g()` will not be able to see it. 

```go
func f() {
    var x = 4
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}

func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```

## Blocks
A sequence of declarations and statements within matching brackets, `{}`.

- You can have a hierarchy of blocks
- Includes function definitions

Hierarchy of **implicit** blocks also 
- *Universe* block: all Go source
- *Package* block: all source in a package
- *File* block: all source in a file
- *if*, *for*, *switch*: all code inside the statement
- Clause in *switch* or *select*: individual clauses each get a block

## Lexical Scoping
Go is lexically scoped using blocks
- b<sub>i</sub> >= b<sub>j</sub> if b<sub>j</sub> is definied **inside** b<sub>i</sub>
    - "defined inside" is transitive

    ### Example 1
    The first block is the file block, and each function `f()` and `g()` is a block. 

    b<sub>2</sub> and b<sub>3</sub> are defined inside b<sub>1</sub>, and accomplish the formula above, but there is no relationship between  b<sub>2</sub> and b<sub>3</sub>. 

    In scoping, when you are resolving a variable, you go to the greater including scope. In `f()` it looks for `x` in b<sub>2</sub> and then goes and looks in b<sub>1</sub> and finds it. It is the same for `g()`.

    ```go
    // file is block 1
    var x = 4                  

    func f() {                  // f is block 2
        fmt.Printf("%d", x)
    }

    func g() {                  // g is block 3
        fmt.Printf("%d", x)
    }
    ```

## Scope of variables
Variable accessible from block b<sub>j</sub> if
1. Variable is declared in block b<sub>i</sub> and 
2. b<sub>i</sub> > b<sub>j</sub>
