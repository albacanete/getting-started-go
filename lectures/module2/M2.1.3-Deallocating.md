# Deallocating Memory

## Deallocating Space
- When a variable is no longer needed, it should be **deallocated**
- Otherwise, we will eventually run out of memory
    
    Each call `f()` creates an integer
    ```go
    func f() {
        var x = 4
        fmt.Printf("%d", x)
    }
    ```

## Stack vs Heap
### Example 1: Heap
```go
var x = 4

func f() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}

func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```
Generally (a bit different in Go)), the Heap is a persistent memory region, it has to be specifically deallocated. 

### Example 2: Stack
```go
func f() {
    var x = 4
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}

func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```
Generally (a bit different in Go), Stack is primarly dedicated to function calls.
- Local variables are stored here
- Deallacoted after function execution

### Manual Deallocation
- Data on the heap must be deallocated when it is done being used
- In most compiled languages, like C, you have to do it manually 
    ```c
    x = malloc(32)
    free(x)
    ```
    - Error-prone, but fast. It it easy for the programmer to make a mistake when allocating/deallocating memory.
- In interpreted languages the interpertor does it and can take time.
