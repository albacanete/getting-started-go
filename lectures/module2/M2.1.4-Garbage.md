# Garbage Collection

## Pointers and deallocation
- Hard to determine when a variable is no longer in use
    ```go
    func foo() *int {
        x := 1
        return &x
    }

    func main() {
        var y *int
        y = foo()
        fmt.Printf("%d", x)
    }
    ```
    In this case, `foo()` returns a pointer to `x`, so the `main()` might still use `x` and you cannot deallocate it even though `foo()` is done.

## Garbage collection
- An automatic tool that deals with deallocation
- In interpreted languages, this is done by **the interpreter**
    - JVM
    - Python Interpreter
- Easier for the programmer
- Slow (needs an interpreter)

Go is a compiled language which enables garbage collection so
- Implementation is fast
- Compiler determines stack vs heap
- Garbage collection is in the background (although takes some small time)
