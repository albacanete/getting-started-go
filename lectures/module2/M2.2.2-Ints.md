# Ints, Floats, Strings

## Type conversions
- Most binary operators need operands of the same time
    - Including assignments
    ```go
    var x int32 = 1
    var y int16 = 2
    x = y
    ```
    This code fails because they are different types of integers, so the compiler throws an error. We need type conversion.
- Convert type with `T()` operation
    ```go
    x = int32(y)
    ```

 ## Floating Point
- `float32` ~ 6 digits of precision
- `float64` ~ 15 digits of precision
- Expressed using decimals or scientific notation
    ```go
    var x float 64 = 132.45
    var y float 64 = 1.3245e2
    ```
- Complex numbers represented as two floats: real and imaginary
    ```go
    var z complex128 = complex(2,3)
    ```

## ASCII and Unicode
### ASCII
- Character coding - each character is associated with an (7) 8-bit number.
    - 'A' = 0x41

### Unicode
- **32-bit** character code
- UTF-8 is a variable length 
    - 8-bit UTF codes are same as ASCII
- **Code points** are Unicode characters
- **Rune** is a code point in Go

## Strings
- Sequence of arbitrary bytes
    - Read-only
    - Often meant to be printed
- String literal is notated by double quotes
    ```go
    x := "Hi there"
    ```
- Each byte is a rune (UTF-8 code point)
