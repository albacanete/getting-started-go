# Constants

- Expression whose value is know at compile time
- Type is inferred from righthand side
    ```go
    const x = 1.3
    const (
        y = 4
        z = "Hi"
    )
    ```

## iota
- Generate a set of related but distinct constants
- Often represents a property which has several distinct possible values
    - Days of the week
    - Months of the year
- Constants **must be different** but the **actual value is not important**
- Like an enumerated type in other languages

### Example
```go
type Grades int
const (
    A Grades = iota
    B
    C
    D
    F
)
```
- Each constant is assigned to a unique integer
- Starts at 1 and increments
- The idea behind `iota` is that you don't care about the actual values, but that they are different from one another
