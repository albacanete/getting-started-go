# Control Flow

Describe the order in which statements are executed inside a program. 

## Control Structures
- Statements which alter control flow
    ```go
    if <condition> {
        <consequent>
    }
    ```
    - Expression `<condition>` is evaluated
    - `<consequent>` statements are executed if condition is `true`

## For Loops
- Iterate while a condition is true
- May have an initialization and update operation
    ```go
    for <init>; <cond>; <update> {
        <stmts>
    }
    ```
### Example 1
```go
for i:=0; i<10; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d", i)
}
```

### Example 2
```go
i := 0
for i<10 {
    fmt.Printf("%d", i)
    i++
}
```

## Switch/Case
- **Switch** is a multi-way if statement
- Switch may contain a **tag** which is a variable to be checked
- Tag is compared to a constant defined in each **case**
- Case wich matches tag is executed

```go
switch x {
    case 1:
        fmt.Printf("case1")
    case 2:
        fmt.Printf("case2")
    default: 
        fmt.Printf("nocase")
}
```
- `default` is executed if none of the cases above matches
