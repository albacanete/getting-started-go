# Hash Tables

Data structure that lets you fast access to large bodies of data
- Contains key/value pairs
    - SSN/email
    - GPS coords/address
- Each value is associated with a **unique** key
- *Hash function* is used to compute the slot for a key

## Tradeoffs and Hash Tables
Advantatges
- Faster lookups than lists
    - Constant-time vs linear-time
- Arbitrary keys
    - Not ints, like slices or arrays

Disadvantatges
- May have collisions
    - Two keys hash to same slot (may slow down program, handled by Go)
