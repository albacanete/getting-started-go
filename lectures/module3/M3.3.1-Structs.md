# Structs

- Aggregate data type
- Groups together other objects of arbitrary type

### Example: Person Struct
Person: name, address and phone

- Option 1: Have 3 separate variables, programmer remembers that they are related. 
- Option 2: Make a single struct which contains all 3 variables

```go
type struct Person {
    name string
    address string
    phone string
}

var p1 Person
```
- Each property is a **field**
- `p1` contains values for all fields

## Accessing Struct fields
- Use dot notation
    ```go
    p1.name = "joe"
    x = p1.addr
    ```

## Initializing Structs
- Can use `new()`
    - Initializes fields to 0
        ```go
        p1 := new(Person)   
        ```
- Can initialize using a struct literal
    ```go
    p1 := Person(name: "joe", addr: "a st.", phone: "123")
