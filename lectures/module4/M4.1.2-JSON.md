# JSON

## JSON Properties
- All Unicode
- Human-readable
- Fairly compact representation
- Types can be combined recursively
    - Array of structs, struct in struct, ...

## JSON Marshalling 
- Generating JSON representation from an object
    ```go
    type struct Person {
        name string
        address string
        phone string
    }
    p1 := Person(name: "joe", addr: "a st.", phone: "123")

    barr, err := json.Marshal(p1)    // byte array, error
    ```
    - `Marshal()` returns JSON representation as []byte

## JSON Unmarshalling
```go
var p2 Person

err := json.Unmarshal(barr, &p2)
```
- `Unmarshal()` converts a JSON []byte into a Go object
- Pointer to Go object is passed to `Unmarshal()`
- Object must "fit" JSON []byte
    - JSON object has some attributes (name, address, phone)
    - `p2` has to have the same attributes (name, address, phone)
