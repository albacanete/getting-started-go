# File Access, ioutil

## Files
- Linear access, not random access 
    - Files used to be physical tapes (linear)
    - Mechanical delay
- Basic operations
    1. **Open**: get handle for access
    2. **Read**: read bytes into []byte
    3. **Write**: write []byte into file
    4. **Close**: release handle
    5. **Seek**: move read/write head

## ioutil File Read
- `"io/ioutil"` package has basic functions
    ```go
    dat, e := ioutil.ReadFile("test.txt")
    ```
- `dat` is []byte filled with contents of entire file
- Explicit open/close are not needed
- Large files cause a problem

## ioutil File Write 
```go
dat = "Hello, world"

err := ioutil.WriteFile("outfile,txt", dat, 0777)
```
- Writes []byte to file
- Creates a file
- Unix-style permission bytes
