# Why Use Functions?

- Set of structions (usually) with a name
    ```go
    func main() {
        fmt.Printf("Hello, world")
    }
    ```
    Is the same as
    ```go
    func PrintHello() {
        fmt.Printf("Hello, world")
    }
    func main() {
        PrintHello()
    }

- Function declaration, name, call

## Reusability
- You only need to declare a function once
- Good for commonly used operations
    - Graphics editing program might have `ThresholdImage()`
    - Database program might have `QueryDbase()`

## Abastraction
- Details are hidden in the function
- Only need to understand operations
- Improves understandability
    ```go 
    func FindPupil() {
        GrabImage()
        FilterImage()
        FindEllipses()
    }
    ```
    - With each of theses functions you might get an idea of what they do but do not need to know how they are implemented
