# Well-Written Functions

## Understandability
- Code is **functions** and **data**
- If you are asked to *find a feature*, you can find it quickly
- If you are asked about *where data is used*, you know

## Debugging Principles
- Code crashes inside a function
    1. Function is written incorrectly
        - Sorts a slice in the wrong order
    2. Data that the function uses is incorrect
        - Sorts slice correctly but slice has wrong elements in it

## Support Debugging
- Functions need to be understandable
    - Determine if actual behaviour matches the desired
- Data needs to be traceable
    - Where did that data come from?
    - Global variables complicate this
