# Guidelines for Functions

## Function Naming
- Give functions a good name
    - Parameter naming counts too
    - This two functions probably do the same, but the first does not say much about but it does
        ```go
        func ProcessArray (a []int) float {}        // not clarifying
        func ComputeRMS (samples []float) float {}  // much more clarifying
        ```
        - RMS = Root Mean Square
        - `samples` is a slice of samples of time-varying signal 

## Functional Cohesion
- A function should perform **only one "operation"**
- An "operation" depends on the context
    - Example: Geometry application
- Good functions
    - `PointDist()`
    - `DrawCircle()`
    - `TriangleArea()`

- Merging behaviours makes code complicated
    - `DrawCircle() + TriangleArea()`

## Few Parameters
- Debugging requires tracing function input data
- More difficult with a large number of parameters
- Function may have bad functional cohesion
    - `DrawCircle()` and `TriangleArea()` require different arguments

## Reducing Parameter Number
- May need to group related arguments into structures
- `TriangleArea()`, bad solution:
    - 3 points needed to define triangle
    - Each point has 3 floats (3D)
    - Total, 9 arguments
- `TriangleArea()`, good solution:
    - `type Point struct {x, y, z float}`
    - Total, 3 arguments
    - You can also create a `type Triangle struct {x, y, z Point}` and the function would take only 1 argument.
