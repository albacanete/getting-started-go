# Support for Classes

## No "Class" Keyword
- Most OO languages have a class keyword
- Data fields and methods are defined inside a class block
    ```python
    # Python example
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, xval, yval):
            self.x = xval
            self.y = yval
    ```

## Associating Methods with Data in Go
- Method has a **receiver type** that is associated with
- Use dot notation to call the method
    ```go
    type MyInt int

    // receiver (mi MyInt) defined before the function name
    func (mi MyInt) Double() int {
        return int(mi*2)
    }

    func main() {
        v := MyInt(3)
        fmt.Println(v.Double())  // call function associated to MyInt type
    }

## Implicit Method Argument
```go
func (mi MyInt) Double() int {
    return int(mi*2)
}

func main() {
    v := MyInt(3)
    fmt.Println(v.Double()) 
}
```
- Object `v`is an **implicit argument** to the method (it is actually being passed to the function).
    - Call by value
