# Support for Classes 2

## Structs, again
- Struct types compose data fields
    ```go
    type Point struct {
        x float64
        y float64
    }
    ```
- Traditional feature of classes

## Structs with Methods
- **Structs and methods** together allow arbitrary data and functions to be composed
    ```go
    func (p Point) DistToOrigin() {
        t := math.Pow(p.x, 2) + math.Pow(p.y, 2)
        return math.Sqrt(t)
    }

    func main() {
        p1 := Point(3, 4)
        fmt.Println(p1.DistToOrigin())
    }
    ```
