# Point Receivers

## Limitations of Methods
- Receiver is **passed implicity** as an argument to the method
- Method cannot modify the data inside the receiver
    - Example: `OffsetX()` should increase x coordinate
        ```go
        func main() {
            p1 := Point(3, 4)
            p1.OffsetX(5)
        }
- Large receivers
    - If receiver is large, lots of copying is required
        ```go
        type Image [100][100]int
        func main() {
            i1 := GrabImage()
            i1.BlurImage()
        }
        ```
        - 10000 ints copiet to `BlurImage()`

## Pointer Receivers
```go
func (p *Point) OffsetX(v float64) {
    p.x = p.x + v
}
```
- Receiver can be a pointer to a type
- Call by reference, point is passed to the method
