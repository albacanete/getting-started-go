# Point Receivers, Referencing, Dereferencing

## No Need to Dereference
```go
func (p *Point) OffsetX(v float64) {
    p.x = p.x + v   // do not need to use *p.x
} 
```
- Point is referenced as `p`, not `*p`
- Dereferencing is automatic with `.` operator

## No Need to Reference
```go
func main() {
    p := Point{3, 4}
    p.OffsetX(5)
    fmt.Println(p.x)
}
```
- Do not need to reference when calling the method

## Using Pointer Receivers
- Good programming practice
    1. All methods for a type have **pointer receivers** 
    2. All methods for a type have **non-pointer receivers**
- Mixing pointer/non-pointer receivers for a type will get confusing
    - Pointer receiver allows modifications
