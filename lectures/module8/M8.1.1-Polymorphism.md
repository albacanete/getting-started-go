# Polymorphism

- Ability for an object to have different "forms" depending on the context
- Example: `Area()` function
    - Rectangle: `area = base * height`
    - Triangle: `area = 0.5 * base * heigh`
- **Identical** at a high level of abstraction
- **Different** at a low level of abstraction

## Inheritance
- Go **does not** have inheritance
- Example: 
    - Superclass `Speaker` 
        - `Speak()` method, prints *noise*
    - Sublclasses `Cat` and `Dog`
        - Also have the `Speak()` method
        - They are different forms of speaker

## Overriding
- Subclass **redefines a method** inherited from the superclass
- Example: Speaker, Cat Dog
    - Speaker `Speak()` prints "*noise*"
    - Cat `Speak()` prints "meow"
    - Dog `Speak()` prints "woof"
- `Speak()` is polymorphic
    - Different implementations for each class
    - Same **signature** (name, params, return)
