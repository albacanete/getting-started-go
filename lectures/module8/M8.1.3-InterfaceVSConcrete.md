# Interface vs Concrete Types

### Concrete Types
- Specify the exact representation of the data and methods
- Complete method implementation is included

### Interface Types
- Specifies some method signatures
- Implementations are abstracted

## Interface Values
- Can be treated like other values
    - Assigned to variables
    - Passed, returned
- Interface values have two components
    1. **Dynamic Type**: Concrete type which it is assigned to
    2. **Dynamic Value**: Value of the dynamic type
- Interface value is actually a pair
    - (dynamic type, dynamic value)

## Defining an Interface Type
```go
type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

type Dog struct {
    name string
}

func (d Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Println(d.name)
}

func main() {
    var s1 Speaker
    var d1 Dog{"Brian"}
    
    s1 = d1     // legal because the Dog type satisfies the s1 interface
    s1.Speak()
}
```
- Dynamic type is `Dog`
- Dynamic value is `d1`

## Interface with Nil Dynamic value
```go
var s1 Speaker
var d1 *Dog

s1 = d1     // d1 is not a concrete object
```
- `d1` has no concrete value yet
- `s1` has a dynamic type but no dynamic value

## Nil Dynamic Value
- Can still call the `Speak()` method of `s1`
- Does not need a dynamic value to call
- No need to check inside the method
    ```go
    func (d *Dog) Speak() {
        if d == nil {
            fmt.Println("<noise>")
        } else {
            fmt.Println(d.name)
        }
    }

    func main() {
        var s1 Speaker
        var d1 *Dog

        s1 = d1
        s1.Speak()
    }
    ```

## Nil Interface Value
- Interface with **nil dynamic type**
- Very different from an interface with a **nil dynamic value**
1. **nil dynamic value** and **valid dynamic type**
    ```go
    var s1 Speaker
    var d1 *Dog
    s1 = d1
    ```
    - Can call a method since type is known
2. **nil dynamic type**
    ```go
    var s1 Speaker
    ``` 
    - Cannot call a method, runtime error
