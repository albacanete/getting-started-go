# Type Assertions

## Concealing Type Differences
- Interfaces hide the differences between types
    ```go
    func FitInYard(s Shape2D) bool {
        if (s.Area() > 100 && s.Perimeter() > 100) {
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    ```
    - Sometimes you need to treat different types in different ways

## Exposing Type Differences
- Example: Graphic program
    - `DrawShape()` will draw any shape
        ```go
        func DrawShape (s Shape2D) {...}
        ```
    - Underlying API has different drawing functions for each shape
        ```go
        func DrawRect(r Rectangle) {...}
        func DrawTriangle(t Triangle) {...}
        ```
    - Concrete type of shape `s` must be determined

## Type Assertions for Disambiguation
- Type assertions can be used to determine and extract the underlying concrete type
    ```go
    func DrawShape(s Shape2D) bool {
        rect, ok := s.(Rectangle)
        if ok {
            DrawRect(rect)
        } 
        tri, ok := s.(Triangle)
        if ok {
            DrawTriangle(tri)
        }
    }
    ```
    - Type assertion extract `Rectangle` from `Shape2D`
        - Concrete type in parenthesis
    - If interface contains concrete type
        - rect == concrete type, ok == true
    - If interface does not contain concrete type
        - rect == zero, ok == false

## Type Switch
- Switch statement used with a type assertion
    ```go
    func DrawShape(s Shape2D) bool {
        switch := sh := s.(type) {
            case Rectangle:
                DrawRect(rect)
            case Triangle:
                DrawTriangle(tri)
        }
    }
    ```
